从 GDSII 设计文件到寄生参数提取的完整集成电路 (IC) 版图分析

该布局分析器是用 C++ 编写的，作为更广泛的 API 的一部分，用于 VLSI IC、封装和电路板设计的电磁设计验证。 代码设计遵循的理念旨在为日益复杂的集成电路、封装和电路板提供最大的可扩展性和最高水平的自动化。 来自图形数据库流 II (GDSII) 文件的设计信息被解析并与模拟输入信息一起存储。

非标准操作模式允许将互连建模平台 (IMP) 文件转换为 GDSII 文件设计。 另一种非标准控制模式将 GDSII 文件设计转换为 [平面直线图](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PlanarStraightLineDrawing.html)，可用作三角测量软件的输入。

加载设计后，可以将信息写入另一个 GDSII 文件或使用全波仿真进行分析，以提取用户指定端口之间的寄生参数。 寄生参数最好通过 [Xyce](https://xyce.sandia.gov/) 子电路文件（来自桑迪亚国家实验室的 SPICE 衍生物）报告，尽管使用 [标准寄生交换格式 (SPEF)](https://ieeexplore. ieee.org/document/5430852) 文件可以交替输出。 请仔细阅读此 **README.md** 文件以获取概述、依赖项和使用说明。

## Installation and Usage
Follow the instructions given in **INSTALL.md** to install this software and run it from the command line. Users from Purdue University should read **purdue\_install.md** instead for specific steps unique to their environment.

## Simulation Input File (.sim_input) Syntax
Every GDSII file needs to have a simulation input file with the .sim\_input extension created for it. The custom syntax of the simulation input file is given at the bottom of this section. It is important that the information in the blocks underneath the headers in all capital letters appear in the order given. Comments start with '#' and continue for the rest of the line. Comments may appear almost anywhere in the file so long as in-line comments are preceded by a space. The following are placeholders, angle brackets and words in between, which must populated depending on the design:
* \<six design extents>: The six coordinates for the smallest rectangular prism enclosing the design with implied units in the order of xmin (the smallest x-coordinate in the design), xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, and zmax (the largest z-coordinate in the design).
    * A lowercase 'e' may be used for scientific notation.
    * For example, `30.00 +149. -47.0 +120. 0.00 +7.53`.
* \<lengthUnit>: The unit by which all given and reported lengths (e.g., total size of design, layer coordinates and heights, and port coordinates) must be multiplied in order to convert to meters. A lowercase 'e' may be used for scientific notation. For example, `1e-6`.
* \<freqUnit>: The unit by which all given and reported temporal frequencies must be multiplied in order to convert to hertz. A lowercase 'e' may be used for scientific notation. For example, `1.0e+6`.
* \<freqStart>: The smallest frequency in the frequency sweep with implied units. For example, `1000.0`.
* \<freqEnd>: The largest frequency in the frequency sweep with implied units. For example, `3000.0`.
* \<nfreq>: The total number of frequencies to include in the sweep. A value of `1` means that \<freqEnd> must equal \<freqStart>. A value of `2` means that only \<freqStart> and \<freqEnd> are included. Any larger integer requires interpolation.
* \<freqScale>: Integer representing the scale for frequency interpolation. The recommended value is `0` for logarithmic spacing. The value `1` is for linear spacing.
* \<numLayer>: The total number of layers in this design. The integer here must match the number of active \<layer entry> lines following this line in the file.
* \<layer entry>: An entire line representing a single layer.
    * The four pieces of information that must be included in order are the layer name at the start of the line, the z-coordinate of the bottom of the layer (designated with 'z = ' before a length with implied units), the height of the layer (designated with 'h = ' before a length with implied units), and the relative permittivity of the dielectric making up that insulating parts of that layer (designated with 'e = ' before a unitless floating-point number greater than or equal to unity).
    * A lowercase 'e' may be used for scientific notation.
    * In order to maintain correspondence with the layer numbers used in a GDSII file, the layer names must be a plain integer (recommended) or be an alphanumeric string with a capital 'M' before the layer number.
    * Optional specifications for each layer entry include the conductivity of conductors in that layer (designated with 'sigma = ' before a nonnegative floating-point number with units of S/m) and the dielectric loss tangent (designated with 'TanD = ' before a nonnegative, unitless floating-point number).
    * It is recommended to add one layer below the bottommost GDSII layer and a second layer above the topmost GDSII layer to serve as planes of perfect electrical conductor (PEC) representing how the design would behave in a testing environment.
    * For example, `ILDM2 z = 1.316 h = 0.12 e = 8.0`.
* \<numPorts>: The total number of ports in this design. The integer here must match the number of active \<port entry> lines following this line in the file.
* \<port entry>: An entire line representing a single port excitation.
    * The eight pieces of information that must be included in order are the port name, the x-coordinate of the supply point of the port, the y-coordinate of the supply point of the port, the z-coordinate of the supply point of the port, the x-coordinate of the return point of the port, the y-coordinate of the return point of the port, the z-coordinate of the return point of the port, and the directionality of the port.
    * Port entries sharing the same name will be converted to a single port with multiple excitations.
    * A lowercase 'e' may be used for scientific notation.
    * The directionality of the port is either '+1' for input ports, '-1' for output ports, or '0' for bidirectional ports or ports with uncertain power flow.
    * A port should be added for each input/output pin of the device. Additional ports are needed for every transistor or other active device in the design. For printed circuit boards (PCBs), at least one port is needed for each component on the populated layout.
    * For example, `port1 +146. -16.0 4.53 +146. +6.00 4.53 -1`.
